EXPENSIFY GO
============

My submission for Expensify's remote coding challenge
-----------------------------------------------------

Building this spiffy HTML5/CSS3/JS/PHP app took me a little over a week in total from start to finish. I put in what I feel like was a decent amount of work to produce a quality product in a relatively short amount of time. 

Some of the challenges I faced while building the app included: learning PHP from scratch, designing the structure of the JavaScript front end, and as in any web development, trying to center that one element inside that one div with CSS. Overcoming my lack of PHP experience was probably the most enjoyable of the challenge. I love leanring knew languages and the knew paradigms and programming constructs they expose. The next most challenging thing I faced was the desiging the JS backbone of the application. I took this challenge head on by iterating fast on my designs until I reached a solution that I was satisfied with. As in all of my software development endeavors, my primary objective for the app was to make it (A) efficient and functional (B) maintainable and readable (C) aesthetically pleasing from a graphic design standpoint and a software architectural standpoint. Because of these high standards, I went through 3-4 full iterations before producing a final product. Though this may not have been necessary for such a "trivial" application, I wanted to show Expensify how I would work on any major software project I am faced with. 

In the end, I am really happy with what I came up with and hope you guys enjoy it as well!
